    "We will give these to a GPT model asking it to extract an imperative process model.\n",
    "Technically, GPT models can generate markup output such as BPMN-XML. This is (currently) not practical, though. Due to the verbosity of XML, the output limit of GPTs prevents the direct generation of complete XML-code even for small BPMN diagrams. Also, after several attempts (on small models), we did not obtain XML code such that it could be displayed by a (commercial) BPMN modeling tool. \n",

We then compare this result to a process model created by a humal modeling expert for the respective description.
