       "\"This process describes a series of actions or steps within an employee expense report or declaration approval workflow. It seems to occur in a corporate or administrative environment, where employees submit declarations of their expenses, which then go through a series of reviews and approvals by multiple parties, such as the supervisor, the administration, and the budget owner.\\n\\nThe process begins with an employee submitting a declaration, which can then follow different paths of approval or rejection by different parties. \\n\\n- Most frequently, the declaration is approved by the Administration and then finally approved by the Supervisor, after which the payment is requested and handled. \\n- Another common route sees the declaration approved by the Administration, then the Budget Owner and finally the Supervisor.\\n- Occasionally, the submission from the employee goes directly to final approval by the Supervisor.\\n- The process also accounts for situations where the declaration is rejected at various stages by different parties (Supervisor, Administration, Budget owner, etc.) Upon rejection, it usually goes back to the employee for resubmission.\\n\\nThere are also some rare routing variants in the process, where a declaration can be rejected by a party not previously involved (labelled as 'MISSING'), or where a declaration needs to be routed for approval by a 'PRE_APPROVER' before going to the Supervisor. \\n\\nFrequencies denote how often a certain transition in the process occurs, while performance indicates the efficiency or speed of these transitions. The higher the performance, the faster the transition occurs. These metrics can help in identifying bottlenecks and opportunities for process improvement.\""

Fifth Most Serious Anomaly: \"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled ( frequency = 4  performance = 9111408.0 )\" This activity sequence represents a significant anomaly as there is no request for payment activity between final approval and payment handling. This could possibly imply an error or a deviation from the standard process. The frequency of occurrence is relatively small, however, the performance is significantly high which could indicate potentially serious implications if overlooked.\n"
