Although it only happens 4 times, it implies a great deal of rework which results in a high performance cost and potentially causing a delay in the final completion of the process.\n",

This causes a delay in process completion and hampers productivity.\n",

      "4. Fourth Most Serious Anomaly: \"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled ( frequency = 40  performance = 1947426.4 )\" This process variant showed an anomaly in the sequence of approval and rejection. The declaration was rejected after it was finalized by the supervisor, which could indicate potential issues with process controls or integrity. \n",

Fifth Most Serious Anomaly: \"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled ( frequency = 4  performance = 9111408.0 )\" This activity sequence represents a significant anomaly as there is no request for payment activity between final approval and payment handling. This could possibly imply an error or a deviation from the standard process. The frequency of occurrence is relatively small, however, the performance is significantly high which could indicate potentially serious implications if overlooked.\n"
